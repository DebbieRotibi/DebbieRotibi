- 👀 I have used Codecademy throughout the year and participated in a two-week summer immersion Girls Who Code program.
- 🌱 I hope to major in Computer Science in college.
- 💞️ Some of my other interests are creative writing and history.
- 📫 I hope to become more "equipped" in terms of my general knowledge for CS, and would like to practice some more coding in different language.
- 👋 I worry that I might not be able to keep up or fall behind considering this is the first proper computer science class I'm taking at school.
